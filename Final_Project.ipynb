Using features like the latest announcements about an organization, their quarterly revenue results, etc., machine learning techniques have the potential to unearth patterns and insights we didn’t see before, and these can be used to make unerringly accurate predictions.\n",

We will implement a mix of machine learning algorithms to predict the future stock price of this company, starting with simple algorithms like averaging and linear regression, and then move on to advanced techniques like Auto ARIMA and LSTM."
